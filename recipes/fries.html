        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>Nacho fries may be on the Taco Bells menu one minute... gone the next, 
            so I created an at-home version AND did it using the air fryer. 
            If you are still inclined to deep-fry, double the amount of seasoning 
            as most will get lost in the hot oil.
        </p>
        <h2>Ingredients.</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>1 teaspoon paprika</li>

            <li> ¼ teaspoon chili powder, or more to taste</li>
                
            <li>¼ teaspoon salt</li>
                
            <li> ⅛ teaspoon onion powder</li>
                
            <li>⅛ teaspoon garlic powder</li>
                
            <li>8 ounces frozen French fries (such as Ore-Ida®)</li>
                
            <li>1 teaspoon vegetable oil</li>
                
            <li> ½ (15 ounce) jar nacho Cheddar cheese sauce (such as Rico's®)</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Directions.</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>
                Preheat an air fryer to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C) according to manufacturer's instructions.
            </li>
            <li>
                Stir paprika, chili powder, salt, onion powder, and garlic powder together in a small bowl.
            </li>
            <li>
                Pour fries into a large bowl. Drizzle vegetable oil over the fries; toss to coat. Sprinkle seasoning mixture over fries; toss until evenly coated.
            </li>
            <li>
                Place seasoned fries in the basket of the preheated air fryer. Cook for 10 minutes. Shake the basket and cook until crisp; about 3 minutes more.
            </li>
            <li>
                Meanwhile, heat cheese sauce in a small saucepan over medium heat. Serve as a dipping sauce for the fries.
            </li>
        </ol>
